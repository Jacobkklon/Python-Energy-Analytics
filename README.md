# Python-Energy-Analytics
Assignments and tasks from my Energy Analytics Python course, mainly done using Jupyter

This showcases my knowledge of Python generally, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and matplotlib. This course gained me experience with these technologies specifically for analysis associated with energy systems, though it is broadly applicable as well.
